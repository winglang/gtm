# Winglang Messaging Guide

## Background

The cloud has evolved to become a ubiquitous platform for running almost every type of application. It allows developers to deliver value by leveraging services and infrastructure, which take care of many of the challenges of building and running software. However, the cloud is a highly dynamic and complex environment, and writing applications often requires understanding low-level details of disparate cloud services. 

Cloud complexity is largely driven by the way applications are built and managed. Currently
available programming languages are designed to tell a single machine what to do. This stands in
contrast to the nature of the cloud, which is basically a single big distributed computer. 

To bridge this gap, backend developers must use custom configuration and code to stitch together
machines and services into a cohesive application. They must use different programming languages,
platforms and tools, and spend significant time and effort on non-functional requirements. The
result is frequent context switching, and increased cognitive load that harms the developer
experience, which in turn impacts productivity and code quality.

The concept of DevOps was formed to address this challenge, aiming to free developers to focus on
writing functional code. However, DevOps teams have become a major bottleneck for innovation and
fast delivery. They are increasingly required to facilitate application deployment for developers
instead of focusing on critical matters such as proactively managing performance, availability and
security. As digital transformation continues to accelerate, these problems exacerbate, resulting in
inefficiencies and friction points:

* Slow "inner-loop" iteration cycles
* Tool fatigue
* Release of "half-baked code"
* Inability to run and test code locally 
* Internal platforms are growing "tax" 
* Cloud provider lock-in 
* Manual and error-prone security/observability processes
* DevOps resources become scarce and expensive

To realize the full benefits of cloud-driven innovation, complexity should be handled at the
compiler level. This calls for a new breed of programming languages that treat the cloud in a
holistic and cohesive manner, abstracting the complexity of the underlying parts, and empowering
developers with self-service capabilities to minimize the reliance on DevOps so they can focus on
writing functional code.

## Company messaging

Monada aims to democratize the cloud with software solutions that enable developers to deliver
better code faster and more securely, with the autonomy to build, run, debug, and test complete
cloud applications within their local environments. Monada was founded by ex-Microsoft, ex-Amazon
with a track record of building successful open-source cloud development tools such as the AWS CDK.

## Primary product messaging

Winglang is a new open-source programming language designed for the cloud. It enables backend
developers to build distributed systems that leverage cloud services as first-class citizens.

Winglang is a statically-typed language that compiles to JavaScript and Terraform. By providing a
built-in local simulator, and an observability & debugging console, Winglang reduces cognitive load
and context switching, enabling developers to stay in their creative flow. 

Wing supports backend developers with self-service capabilities to minimize dependency on DevOps,
improve code quality and security, accelerate delivery, and easily move code between clouds and
platforms.

## Key takeaways (how do we want the end user to feel)

* I can finally focus on what interests me the most - writing functional code, and finding creative
  solutions to complex problems instead of spending time on non-functional requirements
* I can be more productive and independent at my job, and create better code, faster, while keep
  working with my existing tools and platforms
* I will be able to collaborate with fellow backend developers on creating innovative new features
  that will improve my day-to-day workflows

## 25 words

Wing combines infrastructure and runtime code in one language, enabling backend developers to stay
in their creative flow, and to deliver better software, faster and more securely. 

## 50 words

Wing is a cloud-oriented programming language that combines infrastructure and runtime code, with
built-in local simulator and observability & debugging console. Wing enables backend developers to
stay in their creative flow, minimize dependency on DevOps, improve code quality and security,
accelerate delivery, and easily move code between clouds and platforms. 

## 100 words

Wing redefines the cloud development experience with a single language that combines infrastructure
and runtime code. Designed with the goal of enabling backend developers to stay in their creative
flow, Wing features a local simulator and an observability & debugging console that allow for
instant feedback and shortened iteration cycles. Using Wing, developers can create complete cloud
applications while moving most of the complexity from DevOps to the Wing compiler, and minimizing
friction. Instead of manually having to wire up everything, the Wing compiler looks at the code and
automatically produces all the configuration and glue under the hood, freeing developers to focus on
writing functional code.
